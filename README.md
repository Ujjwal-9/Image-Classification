# Image-Classification

In this project, I have classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
I have preprocessed the images, then trained a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and 
the labels need to be one-hot encoded. I have build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
At the end, neural network make predictions on the sample images.
